Kanye Omari West, now known to his fans as Ye, has had undoubtedly the most polarizing professional career of the century so far.
The Atlanta-born rapper, who moved to Chicago with his mother, Donda West, at age 3, has ventured into fashion, politics, and most prominently, controversy.
West started off producing tracks for Jay-Z, with West producing 5 tracks on Jay-Z's album "The Blue Print".
He then went on to drop his debut  album "The College Dropout" in 2004. From then, he rose to stardom. 
The past two decades of West's career include denouncing former President Bush on live TV, taking an award out of pop star Taylor Swift's hands mid-speech, married and divorced Kim Kardashian, endorsed former president Donald Trump, released a gospel album, created a clothing line through Adidas, and praised Hitler.
